## Requirements

### Hardware

- CPU and RAM can be very sollicitated when motion service is running depending on the number of cameras and the resolution of the stream.
- Disk space depends on the number of cameras and the number of days you want to keep images and videos.

### Software and configuration

- **docker** (service must be up and running)
- **A fully qualified domain name** (FQDN) and a valid SSL certificate for this FQDN if you want to access the web interface through a secure connection (https)
- A least a **SPF record** configured for your FQDN, to be able to send email alerts from motion-UI

## Installation and usage

Official documentation is available <a href="https://github.com/lbr38/motion-UI/wiki">here</a>.
